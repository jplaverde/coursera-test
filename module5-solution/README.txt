Hi,
The instructions state:

"REST endpoint https://YOUR-CHOSEN-SUBDOMAIN.herokuapp.com/menu_items/SHORT-NAME.json, where YOUR-CHOSEN-SUBDOMAIN is the subdomain discussed in Lecture50 (Restaurant Server Setup), and the SHORT-NAME is the name the user provided."

and it can be done by following these steps on your computer and creating a domain for yourself:
https://www.coursera.org/lecture/single-page-web-apps-with-angularjs/lecture-50-windows-version-restaurant-server-setup-GFYs4

However, I use exisitng doamin from previous assignments:
https://davids-restaurant.herokuapp.com
I can create my own domain and put in 
common.module.js file on line#5

Also, the image of favorite will not be shown upon sign up as this existing domain(https://davids-restaurant.herokuapp.com) does not have images. Once I put all images in place.

So see list of ids you can enter in favorite dish, you can open URL and use id element. like 877:
https://davids-restaurant.herokuapp.com/menu_items.json
